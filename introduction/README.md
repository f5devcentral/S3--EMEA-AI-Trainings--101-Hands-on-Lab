## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Goals


This lab is a progressive and common-mistake-driven course of the S3 services using MinIO nodes behind a BIG-IP. Our goals are:
- to have an Hands-On experience on the S3 protocol, 
- to understand how it works and it is configured, including common configuration errors or mistakes and what could be their impacts,
- how BIG-IP can help delivering, scaling and securing S3 services.

Many of what we are doing here in this lab is very BIG-IP focused and could be done partially with NGINX or F5XC, so we should keep it as a whole and use it to 
  1/ identify and bring awarness about the pain points
  2/ demonstrate the values we will demonstrate to our customers.

It is not an exhaustive lab and many S3 or S3 related features are not covered. Just a 101 so you are comfortable engaging with your customer, your Storage Engineer counterpart and our S3 Storage Partner.

### 1.2 What you should learn by doing this lab?

- S3 components
- Terminology
- S3 Authentication and Authorization
- How to configure your BIG-IP to Load Balance and Secure S3 services.

<br><br>

### 1.3 Duration
This lab is intended for **2 hours**. Of course you can make it faster is you are already an S3 expert, if you're a cheater or - if like me - you excel in copying and pasting.

You can also make it longer and try different combinations. Beauty of UDF: if you crash the lab, delete and redeploy from blueprint.
